## Mergesort Time
Determine the complexity and runtime of sorting a set of numbers using a mergesort algorithm.

## Usage
Run ```make``` to build the program.

Run ```main <filename>``` on the TXT file of numbers.

The TXT file should be formatted with each number to be sorted on a separate line, such as in the example file  ```set00.txt```.
